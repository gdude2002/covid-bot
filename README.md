# Covid Bot

This is a simple, unconfigurable bot that scrapes [this page](https://vaccine.hse.ie/) and posts a message when 
vaccines are available for a new age group.

It's designed with one specific community in mind, so it's very inflexible. Feel free to fork it for your own if you
wish.

Also, I'm lazy, so I didn't change the Maven group from the template defaults.
